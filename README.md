# PranGearView
*A lightweight, customizable way to view your equipped gear*

## Highlights
- Allows for a wide range of text color and size customization
- Lets you know when items are missing sockets, gems, and enchants
- Provides an interface for customizing the order of secondary and tertiary stats under the *Enchancements* category based on class and specialization
- Shows abbreviated names for item enchants to reduce visual clutter
- Allows quick showing/hiding of enchant text if you are only concerned with the quality of the enchant (Dragonflight enchants and onward)
- Indicates when equipped items have embellishments

## Summary
**PranGearView** allows you to display customized information about your character in the Character Info window. If you want to know what item level each equipped item is, whether any sockets, gems, or enchants are missing, or what each equipped item's durability is, then this AddOn will serve you well. It is designed to be used on top of Blizzard's default Character Info window with the goal of not needing to install entire UI packs to have this information available.

As mentioned earlier, this AddOn was developed to work on Blizzard's default Character Info UI, so this may cause unexpected interactions when run with other AddOns or UI packs. If you would like to report any issues, please reach out with a description of the problem along with a list of all AddOns that were enabled when this was observed. Screenshots can also be helpful in troubleshooting and fixing these types of issues.
